    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first assignment. This exercise gives you a brief introduction to Python. Even if you've used Python before, this will help familiarize you with functions we'll need.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "- You will be using Python 3.\n",
    "- Avoid using for-loops and while-loops, unless you are explicitly told to do so.\n",
    "- Do not modify the (# GRADED FUNCTION [function name]) comment in some cells. Your work would not be graded if you change this. Each cell containing that comment should only contain one function.\n",
    "- After coding your function, run the cell right below it to check if your result is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After this assignment you will:**\n",
    "- Be able to use iPython Notebooks\n",
    "- Be able to use numpy functions and numpy matrix/vector operations\n",
    "- Understand the concept of \"broadcasting\"\n",
    "- Be able to vectorize code\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!"

    "## About iPython Notebooks ##\n",
    "\n",
    "iPython Notebooks are interactive coding environments embedded in a webpage. You will be using iPython notebooks in this class. You only need to write code between the ### START CODE HERE ### and ### END CODE HERE ### comments. After writing your code, you can run the cell by either pressing \"SHIFT\"+\"ENTER\" or by clicking on \"Run Cell\" (denoted by a play symbol) in the upper bar of the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will often specify \"(≈ X lines of code)\" in the comments to tell you about how much code you need to write. It is just a rough estimate, so don't feel bad if your code is longer or shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**: Set test to `\"Hello World\"` in the cell below to print \"Hello World\" and run the two cells below."
